# Lyrics Pagination

> **13 nodes** | **Cohesion: 0.23** | **Primary files:** `src/utils/lyricsPagination.js`, `src/components/lyrics/PaginatedLyricsDisplay.jsx`, `KaraokeLyricsDisplay.jsx`

Splits long karaoke songs into readable "pages" of lyrics (like a teleprompter). Calculates which lyrics lines fit on screen based on timing and line count, then provides page-forward/page-back navigation.

### Key Nodes
- `getCurrentPage()` — determines which page of lyrics is currently visible
- `lyricsPagination.js` — page calculation with line grouping
- `PaginatedLyricsDisplay` — renders current page with animations
- `KaraokeLyricsDisplay` — full-screen lyrics overlay with word highlighting
